# purely to avoid a second layer for it - it's otherwise unrelated to the
# build: baked into this stage (which has a shell) rather than the
# distroless one below (which doesn't), because DB_PATH defaults to a file
# under here, and a write-path token is issued by running this same binary
# again against that file (`token issue`), so it needs to exist and be
# writable before the distroless stage's own USER ever runs.
